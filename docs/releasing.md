# Release a version

Use release-it to prepare versions and release notes. [Testing](testing.md) covers development validation. This extension is distributed as a VSIX; npm publication is disabled.

## Prepare the version

Start with a clean checkout:

```sh
npm run release:preview
npm run release:prepare
```

Preview shows the proposed version and notes without changing files. Preparation updates `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md` without committing, tagging, or pushing.

Release tooling recommends the version from [Conventional Commit messages](../CONTRIBUTING.md#write-commit-messages).

Generate release entries with release-it's `conventionalcommits` preset. Publish the generated version section from `CHANGELOG.md` unchanged. The preset includes features, fixes, performance improvements, reverts, and breaking changes. Routine maintenance commits are omitted; a maintenance-only release can have no entries.

Review commit messages before merging because their descriptions become public release entries. Add no manual introductions, feature summaries, or validation paragraphs to release notes.

To choose a version, use `npm run release:prepare -- 1.0.0`. For the first release, `npm run release:prepare -- --no-increment` keeps the current version and prepares its notes.

Review the version and generated entries, then commit the prepared files.

## Optional checks

```sh
npm run release:validate
```

This runs local, browser, native, and installed-package tests. Run it when needed; publication does not run it or require a passing CI workflow. Individual checks are listed in [testing](testing.md).

## Publish the version

Build the VSIX:

```sh
npm run package
```

This builds `.artifacts/git-native-ui.vsix` and checks its contents without running tests. Rebuild after changing the candidate.

The Marketplace publisher is `andreymyssak`; the extension identifier is `andreymyssak.git-native-ui`. Its listing URL is [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreymyssak.git-native-ui).

Upload the VSIX under that publisher in Marketplace management. With publishing credentials configured, publish the same package from the terminal:

```sh
npm run release:marketplace
```

To also create a GitHub release, use a clean checkout on `main` and provide `GITHUB_TOKEN` with release access:

```sh
npm run release
```

The command creates and pushes `v<version>`, creates a GitHub release, and attaches the built VSIX. It copies the prepared changelog section unchanged without running tests or waiting for CI.

Publish only with explicit authorization.
