# Architecture

Git UI has an extension host for Git access and React webviews for Log/Worktrees and Source Control's Commit/Stashes view.

## Modules

| Location                        | Responsibility                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/extension/activate.ts`     | Registers the view and commands.                                                   |
| `src/extension/panel/`          | Webview lifecycle, request validation and coordination.                            |
| `src/extension/changes/`        | Checkbox inclusion and unsaved-file prompts.                                       |
| `src/extension/source-control/` | Combined Commit/Stashes view, drafts, checked-file actions and message generation. |
| `src/extension/git/`            | Repository reads, serialized Git writes and history recovery.                      |
| `src/extension/native/`         | VS Code dialogs, notifications, editors and worktree opening.                      |
| `src/shared/`                   | Serializable contracts and pure models shared by host and webview.                 |
| `src/webview/app/`              | Layout, host communication and saved view state.                                   |
| `src/webview/pages/`            | Log, Worktrees, Commit and Stash workflows.                                        |
| `src/webview/shared/`           | Reusable controls, icons and browser bridge.                                       |

The webview sends requests to the extension host. The host validates their repository and targets before calling the Git adapter. Repository changes invalidate stale requests.

The Git adapter uses the installed Git extension where possible and explicit Git calls for API gaps. VS Code provides native diffs and conflict resolution. The [backend ADR](adr/0002-git-operation-backends.md) and [history recovery ADR](adr/0003-history-replay-and-recovery.md) explain those choices.

The Source Control view combines Commit and Stashes tabs and works independently of the Log webview. Checked files are an inclusion choice, not staged state. Selected commits and stash creation use a temporary index to exclude unchecked staged changes. Native mutations share the repository operation queue; linked worktrees also share a lock for their common Git directory. Stashes use ordinary Git stashes and retain them after restoration.

Pages own workflow UI and saved view preferences. The extension host owns Source Control drafts and checked-file state. Shared contracts contain no VS Code, Node or DOM dependencies.

Log, Commit and Stash use the file tree in `src/webview/shared/ui/file-tree/`. Each page supplies its files and actions; the shared component owns rows, folder grouping, icons, keyboard navigation and optional checkboxes.

`package.json` owns extension identity. Builds inject its name, publisher, display name and command namespace into `src/shared/extension-identity.ts`, which derives command, URI, helper and recovery identifiers. Menu payloads use domain field names without a branding prefix.

## Dependencies and generated code

React handles presentation. TanStack Virtual handles history virtualization, and Floating UI handles popovers. Styling is described in [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md).

Only `src/webview/pages/log/lib/graph/` imports `src/vendor/vscode-graph/`. That directory is generated from recorded upstream inputs and patches. Follow [VS Code maintenance](upstream.md) when changing it. [The graph ADR](adr/0001-graph-extraction.md) explains the extraction decision.

Build and validation scripts live in `scripts/`; tests live in `test/`. Generated reports and indexes stay in ignored `.artifacts/` and `.codegraph/`. [Development](development.md) covers setup and [testing](testing.md) covers validation.
